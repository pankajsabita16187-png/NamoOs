# NamoOs â€” Custom Mobile Linux (Prototype)

**NamoOs** is a custom Linux-based mobile OS project scaffold. This archive contains the full GitHub-style project layout:
- Buildroot configuration and instructions
- Kernel config stubs
- Systemd init units and init scripts
- Qt/QML UI shell (simple)
- Antivirus subsystem (scanner stubs, sandbox script, rule files)
- Apps folder with placeholders for WhatsApp, Google services, Instagram, and Facebook (Facebook is intentionally blocked)
- Installer script that installs allowed third-party APKs if you provide them (no proprietary binaries are included)

**Important:** This project is a prototype scaffold. It does NOT contain proprietary apps (WhatsApp, Google Play Services, Instagram, Facebook) or device-specific drivers. To include those apps you must obtain their APKs or binaries from legal sources and place them into `third_party_apks/` before running the installer.

## What this ZIP provides
- A ready-to-edit repo layout to build NamoOs using Buildroot or adapt to Yocto.
- Scripts to assemble a QEMU-bootable image (emulation depends on your host).
- Antivirus sandboxing and rules that block Facebook domains and block the Facebook app from being installed.
- `install_apps.sh` script which will only install allowed apps (WhatsApp, Google, Instagram) if you supply their APKs; it will skip/block Facebook and add Facebook domains to hosts-based blocking.

## How to use
1. Extract this ZIP.
2. Read `docs/BUILDING.md` for build steps (Buildroot required).
3. Place any third-party APKs in `third_party_apks/` (optional). **Do not** include APKs in this repo.
4. Run `scripts/install_apps.sh` to copy allowed APKs into the system rootfs overlay for packaging. Facebook APK will be rejected by the installer.
5. Build NamoOs with `build/build.sh` and run with `build/run_qemu.sh` or deploy to hardware.
